## The Challenge

The challenge is to build a simple Flickr search and view tool. This will need to be built using React-Native for the iOS platform. You can ignore testing on Android.

The main interface will be a grid view with a search bar.

When you search for a term in the search bar, the grid view will show at least the first 10 photo thumbnails of the results that are returned through the Flickr API (https://www.flickr.com/services/api).

Tapping each photo should take you to a separate view where you can view a larger version of the photo.

In the main interface, create a dropdown somewhere where you can sort the image by Date (asc/desc) and other key indicators as you find appropriate.



- sort images by {options}
- display more info for each pic?
- click on thumbnail for more info
